            <h2>🧠 My Approach to Care</h2>
            <p>
              I believe that every patient deserves to feel <strong>heard</strong>, <strong>respected</strong>, and <strong>supported</strong>. 
              That’s why I focus on building meaningful, patient-centred relationships rooted in <strong>open communication, empathy, and trust</strong>. 
              Your comfort, understanding, and peace of mind are at the heart of every consultation.
